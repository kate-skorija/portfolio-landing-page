      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>My Path</h3>
          <p>My interest in programming grew out of a converstaion in an unlikely place: the backcountry of Colorado.
            After spending the summer doing conservation field work, I took a roadtrip through Colorado. 
            Around a campfire one evening, I met a previous Epicodus student and we talked through the evening about his education and work. 
            I had considered coding previously, but it always seemed like something I'd never be able to tackle in this lifetime. 
            I wasn't particularly technologically adept, and at the time I didn't have any social media or even a cell phone.
            My new friend ensured me that I was capable, and after learning on my own for the rest of the fall, I enrolled in Epicodus.
