          <h3>My Programming Path</h3>
            <p>My interest in programming grew out of a converstaion in an unlikely place: the backcountry of Colorado.
              After graduating college, I worked at a lovely public library for almost four years while continuing classes in information science.
              Although I enjoyed the community-oriented nature and big picture goals of the institution, I began to get bored with my daily work. 
              I decided to switch things up, and live outside for the rest of the year to achieve one of my other life-goals: being a conservationist.
              After spending the summer and fall doing field work, I took a roadtrip through Colorado. 
              Around a campfire one evening, I met a previous Epicodus student and we talked through the evening about his education and work. 
              This is when I came to realize that programming had the potential to provide me with a challenging, creative, and fullfilling career.
              I had considered trying to code previously, but it always seemed like something I'd never be able to tackle in this lifetime. 
              I wasn't particularly technologically adept, and at the time I didn't have any social media or even a cell phone.
              My new friend ensured me that I was capable, and after learning on my own for the rest of the winter, I enrolled in Epicodus in the spring.
