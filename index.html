            <h3>Favorite Band Website</h3>
            <p>In this project, I practiced adding floats to images and creating a sidebar using <strong>CSS</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>.
            I also learned about the box model, and how to apply borders, padding, and margins.

            <p>This website helped me practice linking to separate pages within one website using <strong>HTML</strong>. 
            This is also the first time I created multiple branches for a project to test <strong>CSS</strong> styling, ultimately merging them for the final result.</p>

          <h3>My Programming Path</h3>
          <p>My interest in programming grew out of a conversation in an unlikely place: the backcountry of Colorado.
            After graduating college, I worked at a lovely public library for almost four years while continuing classes in information science.
            Although I enjoyed the community-oriented nature and big picture goals of the institution, I began to get bored with my daily work. 
            I decided to switch things up, and live outside for the rest of the year to achieve one of my other life-goals: being a conservationist.
            After spending the summer and fall doing field work, I took a roadtrip through Colorado. 
            Around a campfire one evening, I met a previous Epicodus student and we talked through the evening about his education and work. 
            This is when I came to realize that programming had the potential to provide me with a <em>challenging, creative, and fullfilling</em> career.
            I had considered trying to code previously, but it always seemed like something I'd never be able to tackle in this lifetime. 
            I wasn't technologically adept, and at the time I didn't have any social media or even a working cell phone.
            My new friend ensured me that I was capable, and after learning on my own for the rest of the winter I enrolled in Epicodus in the spring.
